\section{Maps of constant rank}

\begin{definition}
    Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds. Let $F : M \to N$ be a smooth map, and let $p \in M$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We define the \emph{rank of $F$ at $p$} to be the rank of the linear map $dF_p : T_pM \to T_{F(p)}N$. If $F$ has same rank $r$ at every point of $M$, then we say that it has \emph{constant rank}, and denote $\rank{F} = r$.
        \item The smooth map $F$ is called a \emph{s}
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
