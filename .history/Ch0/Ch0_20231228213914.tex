\section{Na\"ive theory}

We begin with na\"ive set theory. A \emph{set} $A$ is an unordered collection of objects. If $x$ is an object, we say that $x$ is an element of $A$ or $x \in A$ if $x$ lies in $A$, otherwise we say that $x \notin A$.

\begin{axiom}[Extension]
    Two sets $A$ and $B$ are equal, $A = B$, if and only if they have same elements.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}
    
\end{axiom}
