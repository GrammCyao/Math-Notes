\section{Na\"ive set theory}

We begin with na\"ive set theory. A \emph{set} $A$ is an unordered collection of objects. If $x$ is an object and if $x$ lies in $A$, we say that $x$ is an element of $A$, and we write
    \begin{align*}
        x \in A,
    \end{align*}
otherwise we write
    \begin{align*}
        x \notin A.
    \end{align*}

If $A, B$ are sets and if every element of $A$ is an element of $B$, we say that $A$ is a \emph{subset} of $B$, and we write
    \begin{align*}
        A \subset B.
    \end{align*}

\begin{axiom}[Axiom of extension]
    Two sets $A$ and $B$ are equal, denoted $A = B$, if and only if they have same elements.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[Axiom of specification]
    Let $A$ be a set, and for each $x \in A$, let $P(x)$ be a property pertaining to $x$. Then there exists a set 
    \begin{align*}
        \{x \in A : P(x) \text{ is true}\},
    \end{align*}
    whose elements are precisely those elements $x$ in $A$ for which $P(x)$ is true. In other words, for any object $y$,
        \begin{align*}
            y \in \{x \in A : P(x) \text{ is true}\}
            \Longleftrightarrow 
            (y \in A \text{ and } P(y) \text{ is true}).
        \end{align*}
\end{axiom}

The axiom of specification assures the existence of empty set which without any elements at all.

\begin{definition}[Empty set]
    Let $A$ be a set. The \emph{empty set} $\emptyset$ is defined to be the set
        \begin{align*}
            \emptyset := \{x \in A : x \neq x\}.
        \end{align*}
\end{definition}

The axiom of extension implies that there can be only one set with no elements. Thus the empty set is well-defined.
